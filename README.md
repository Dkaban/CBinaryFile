## IDE Used: CLion
A simple menu system that allows the user to create a Binary File.

### Functionality
- The user is displayed options (Create, Display Contents, Search, Update, Delete, and Exit).
- The user must create a Binary file before trying to do any other options besides exit.
- When the file is created there is a prompt to enter information to populate the file.

### Note: There needs to be a bit more error checking in the scanf's to correctly check inputs.
